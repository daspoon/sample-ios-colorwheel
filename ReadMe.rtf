This is a simple application designed to illustrate the use of the GxColorPickerViewController class, which is used for color selection.  On launch the application shows a table view which presents a list of 'favorite' colors; selecting a table view item will navigate to the color picker view; interaction with the color picker will effect the corresponding color in the favorites list.\
\
This example is not intended to illustrate a polished/complete application, but rather a demonstration of good class design.  The files of interest are ColorPickerViewController.*, ColorWheel.*, and EAGLView.*, located in the 'Library classes' project group.\
